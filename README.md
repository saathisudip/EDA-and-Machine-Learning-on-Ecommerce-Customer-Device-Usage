# Exploratory Data Analysis and Linear Regression Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook where Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Linear Regression analysis have been performed on a dataset. The primary goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the data and understand the relationships between variables using linear regression.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the Jupyter notebook, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.11
- Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saathisudip/EDA-and-Machine-Learning-on-Ecommerce-Customer-Device-Usage.git
cd EDA-and-Machine-Learning-on-Ecommerce-Customer-Device-Usage
```

2. Run Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open the notebook in your browser and navigate to the `analysis.ipynb` file.

## Notebook Contents

1. **Introduction:**
    - Brief overview of the dataset and the problem statement.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Data loading and cleaning
    - Visualization of key features using plots and graphs.

3. **Linear Regression Analysis:**
